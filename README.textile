h1. Fonsi
h1. Facebook Online Navigation System for pervasive Interaction 

Fonsi allows users to navigate and like facebook posts through gesture interactions.

h2. Installation

Fonsi has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8 (due to the Intel SDK being available for only Windows at the moment) with Processing version 2.08b.

Clone into Processing folder and copy libraries into Processing Libraries folder. The Intel SDK should also be installed on the system.

Install a webserver onto the machine, XAMPP is my prefered LAMP setup for Windows, and copy the web_client folder into the htdocs root.  This is needed as the Facebook Javascript API needs to pass a domain back to Facbook to validate the current Application ID.  The Application ID has been approved to run from the http://localhost domain, so visit http://localhost/web_client/ to run.

Start the Processing Skecth to run the Websocket Server then visit http://localhost/web_client/.  You should see the image from the camera (Press "esc" or "s" to toggle camera images) on the browser. 

h2.  To Use

Swipe left or right to navigate posts.  Thumbs up to like a post.  Ayyyyyyyyyyyye!
